## Inspiration

This was the first music-playback application I made and was created with user experience as the focal point in terms of interactivity, dynamic UI based on current song playback, and rendering/song data delivery speeds. Note: this project's UI was based on a popular music playback web application but is unaffiliated with any official web playback applications and was made for personal, non-commercial purposes.

## Usage

This application served nostly as a proof-of-concept build that is no longer functional to reduce charges incurred by AWS for T2 and S3 hosting (to host the server and music data, respectively).

## Features

This is a user-centric music playback application that was optimized for playback by incorporating a dynamic UI based on the currently-playing song.

-   Colors are rendered based on primary colors in album art
-   Waveform is dynamically rendered based on song's waveform data
-   Time since posting is dynamically-rendered based on time since upload
